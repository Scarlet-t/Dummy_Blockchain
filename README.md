A simple Blockchain implementation in python. I thought it would make me feel smart.
  
Maybe I'll truly feel smart once i attempt to write my own sha256 algorithm (planned).  
  
And if that doesn't make me feel smart, at least I'll learn something that seems pretty cool.  
  
What? Intelligence is a social construct - you say?  
  
ummum we *do* in fact live in a society, thus the validity of a social construct isn't void for the reason of "man made".  
  
well yea but is there any utility in sorting people per their ability in a specific form of cognition? hey, actually how is 'intelligence' defined again?  
  
idk... "smart" i guess  
  
well folks, that's our verdict.
